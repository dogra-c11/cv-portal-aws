# Login App (Frontend + Backend)

This folder contains the full implementation of the login system used in the CV Portal. It's built using:

- **Frontend**: React (with Vite)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (for auth users)
- **Security**: JWT authentication, MFA (optional), rate limiting, input sanitization

---

## Features

- Email/password login with "Remember Me"
- Optional MFA
- Account lockout after repeated failed attempts
- Password strength check and feedback
- Forgot password workflow
- JWT-based auth with protected routes
- Frontend form validations with accessibility
- Fully responsive UI with external CSS

  **Note**: For now, MFA and Forgot Password do not send actual emails â€” the one-time code can be checked from db for testing purposes.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd login-app/server
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Set the environment variables
npm run dev
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd login-app/client
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Set the environment variables
npm run dev
```

Make sure both backend and frontend are running in parallel.
